EXPLORER MODE
- Create an index.html file that pulls in a file called main.js. Within main.js, write your script to complete the assignment. Make sure that you console.log the final output.
To complete this assignment correctly, you must do all of the following:
- Create an empty array
- Dynamically add 5 of your favorite movies to the array, one by one (rather than at creation time)
- Make sure each movie object has a title, director list, genre, year, and actor list
- After adding each movie, sort the array by title
- Convert and output the entire list as JSON

ADVENTURE MODE
- Output the results to HTML instead/in addition. Create a table of your movies with the information for each, for instance. And, hey, use Bootstrap.
- Add a ratings property to each movie that has both IMDB's star rating and IMDB's Metascore rating
- Sort the movies by their star rating
- Make another list of the worst films ever, in your opinion, and combine them with your favorites

EPIC MODE
- Grab some example JSON API movie data from http://www.omdbapi.com/ and parse it
- Experiment with getting your favorite movies pulled back via an AJAX API request
- Experiment with another API's data (see: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
